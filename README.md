ObsPyck is a GUI application that is intended to cover the tasks in a standard analysis workflow for seismic events in seismological observatory practice.

For FAQ see the [list of issues with the "question" label](https://github.com/megies/obspyck/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion+).

This version of Obsypck hs had a few changes applied to it, to make it compatible with the Victorian co-ordinates and the University of Melbourne's locl seismic array. For details of these changes, contact Abraham Jones at asjones@student.unimelb.edu.au.
